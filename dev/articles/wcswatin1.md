# Quick Intro for wcswatin Package

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**This is a Vignette on how to use the wcswatin package.**

## Description of the tool

wcswatin (Climate & Weater SWAT input) is an open-source R package for
preparing weather and climate data from different sources for input in
the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Currently two blocks of
processing routines are implemented, one for the pre-processing of
NetCDF and tif raster files as made available from a increasing number
of data-providing institutions around the globe and a second one for the
upscaling of physical station data by interpolation methods.

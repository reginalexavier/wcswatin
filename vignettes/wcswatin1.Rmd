**This is a Vignette on how to use the wcswatin package.**

## Description of the tool

wcswatin (Climate & Weater SWAT input) is an open-source R package for preparing weather and climate data from different sources for input in the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Currently two blocks of processing routines are implemented, one for the pre-processing of NetCDF and tif raster files as made available from a increasing number of data-providing institutions around the globe and a second one for the upscaling of physical station data by interpolation methods.

\title{cwswatinput: Climate & Weather SWAT Input.}
\description{
cwswatinput (Climate & Weather SWAT input) is an open-source R package for
preparing weather and climate data from different sources for input in the
Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), funded by the Critical Ecosystem
Partnership Fund (CEPF). Currently two blocks of processing routines are
implemented, one for the pre-processing of NetCDF and tif raster files as
made available from a increasing number of data-providing institutions around
the globe and a second one for the upscaling of physical station data by
interpolation methods. For processing all used datasets MUST have geographic
coordinates using WGS 84 as datum.
